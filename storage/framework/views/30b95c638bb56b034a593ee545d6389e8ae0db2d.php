                    <h6>Voluntary information:</h6>
                    <p>We may collect additional information at other times, including but not limited to, when you provide

                    <h5>B. INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED/ TRACKED WHILE NAVIGATION </h5>
                    <h6>Cookies:</h6>
                    <p>To improve the responsiveness of the Sites for our Users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools 
                        to collect Information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) 
                        to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer or device. Unless you 
                        voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you 
                        are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer or device. The only personal information a cookie can 
                        contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or device. Our advertisers 
                        may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads etc.), a process that we do not 
                        control. We receive and store certain types of Information whenever you interact with us via Site or Service 
                        through your computer/laptop/netbook or mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device etc.</p>
                    <h6>Opting out</h6>

                        browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie 
                        ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser. </p>
                    <h6>Log File Information</h6>
                    <p>We automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet,
